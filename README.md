Backend:
- [x] data crawler
- [x] cron job to run data crawler and send email
- [x] RESTful API

Frontend:
- [x] Google Map API, markers
- [x] showing data
- [x] forms to register for email sending

ToDo:
- [ ] small bugs on initially fetching data
- [ ] cron job improvement (seems like new positions are only posted 12am each day)
